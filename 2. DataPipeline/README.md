### Shopify Order Data Pipeline: Automating Shopify to Azure & Monday.com

#### 📌 Overview
This project is an automated data pipeline that fetches new Shopify orders via webhooks, processes them in Retool, and updates both Monday.com boards and an internal Azure database. It eliminates manual data entry, ensuring real-time synchronization and improved efficiency.

#### 🚀 Features
Webhook-triggered automation: Listens for new Shopify orders and initiates data flow.

API-driven data processing: Utilizes Shopify, Monday.com, and Azure APIs.

Data transformation & validation: Formats and cleans order details before pushing them.

Scalable & modular architecture: Built with Retool workflows and flexible API integrations.

#### 📜 How It Works
Trigger: A Shopify webhook detects a new order and sends data.

Data Fetching: Retool queries Shopify's API for additional order details.

Processing: Data is cleaned, formatted, and validated within Retool.

Storage & Sync: Order details are stored in an Azure database. Key information is pushed to relevant Monday.com boards for tracking.

Duplicate Handling: Filters prevent duplicate order entries.
