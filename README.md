# Dunder Mifflin Paper Company - Order Processing Fee Analysis

## Project Overview

This portfolio project demonstrates comprehensive data analysis and statistical techniques applied to a fictional paper distribution company, Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. The analysis examines order processing fees, customer demographics, and geographic sales patterns to provide actionable business insights.

## Business Context

Dunder Mifflin Paper Company is a B2B paper distributor serving businesses across the United Kingdom. The company charges a processing fee for each order based on the customer's monthly order value, calculated as approximately one week's worth of their average monthly orders (Monthly Order Value × 12 ÷ 52).

## Dataset

- **Orders**: 26,833 order records with processing fees, order values, and sales regions
- **Customers**: 41,513 customer records with business establishment years
- **Time Period**: Orders from May 2023 to May 2024
- **Geographic Coverage**: 50+ UK sales regions

## Analysis Questions

1. **Distribution Analysis**: Analyze and visualize the distribution of processing fees using descriptive statistics
2. **Central Tendency**: Determine the most appropriate measure of average processing fee for business reporting
3. **High-Value Orders**: Analyze orders with processing fees > £500 and identify patterns
4. **Geographic Insights**: Visualize sales data by region and extract commercial insights
5. **Sales Investigation**: Develop a structured approach to investigate sudden sales declines
6. **Statistical Testing**: Determine statistical significance of marketing test results

## Key Findings

- Processing fees follow a right-skewed distribution (skewness = 2.18)
- Median processing fee (£214.62) is more representative than mean (£249.93)
- 95.28% of orders have processing fees ≤ £500
- Manchester region dominates with 18% of sales volume
- Younger businesses (0-7 years) are associated with higher-value bulk orders
- 69.16% of processing fees match the expected formula calculation

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

- **Statistical Analysis**: Descriptive statistics, distribution analysis, skewness, coefficient of variation
- **Data Visualization**: Histograms, scatter plots, bar charts, geographic analysis
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Two-proportion z-tests, statistical significance testing
- **Python Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy
- **Business Intelligence**: KPI reporting, geographic segmentation, customer demographics
- **Presentation**: Professional slide deck with data-driven insights

## Tools & Technologies

- Python 3.11
- pandas, numpy for data manipulation
- matplotlib, seaborn for visualization
- scipy for statistical testing
- Excel for data storage
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript for presentation slides
