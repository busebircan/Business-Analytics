# Small Business Simulation Modelling and Analysis with Arena: A Coffee Shop Example
# Objective
Simulation modelling is an imitation of a system providing the opportunity to detect problems and test potential
solutions without making costly changes in real-world systems. This study aims to present an approach for how
simulation techniques can help local business managers improve their businesses by an example implementation
on a fictional local coffee shop system in Edinburgh. Based on several assumptions on processes and customer behaviour, outputs of the model are analysed through Process Analyzer and OptQuest optimization tools of Arena Simulation Software and recommendations on main resources which are people and tables in this case are reported as conclusions with the objective of increasing business's sales revenue.
# Input Data
Input data includes customer arrival rates, process times for order receipt, order preparation and delivery, table
cleaning and also seizing table and sojourn for the customers, resource capacities and prices for served products and probability assumptions on customer decisions e.g. whether to order or not, whether to wait for a table or not.
# Simulation Model
The simulation model of STJ Coffee Shop consists of three main parts; (1) customer arrival and order
receipt, (2) order preparation and delivery, (3) table assignment for sit-in customers and departure.
Outputs of the model with different scenarios (different resource capacities as people and tables) are analyzed to guide decision making on investing in new resources. Process Analyzer and Optquest results are shared in Excel file.
# Conclusions
By analysing the output of simulating the processes and customer behaviour for STJ Coffee Shop in Arena, we
conclude human resource capacity is the main problem for the business where improvements for the seating capacity
is also required. Amongst possible solutions in order to increase sales revenue and customer satisfaction, Process
Analyser and OptQuest tools provide in-line best solutions; recommending an additional full-time staff and an
increase in the number of 2-seater tables. Though it can be recommended to increase the number of tables as many
as possible, this is more up to business owners’ own preferences and changes in customer behaviour in time since
it is relatively less effective for the key outputs. With recommended actions, it is possible to decrease weekly
customer loss by 50% and increase the coffee shop’s weekly revenue by 23%.
