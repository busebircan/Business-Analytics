# Assessing Effectiveness of Three Web Campaigns Using Web Analytics with Visitor Clickstream Data
## Overview of Campaign Effectiveness
In order to evaluate three campaigns’ effectiveness bounce rate, conversion rate and average number of visited pages per visitor session in the website can be measured for initial insights.
Bounce rate is the rate of 1-page visits coming from that source to all visits from the source; to be lower for a good source. Conversion rate is the rate of visits which successfully completed purchases to all visits from the source; to be high for a good a source.
With these rates, detecting the best source for people to reach the website is the objective.

Paid and unpaid access sources to the website are compared which are partner adverts, facebook adverts, linkedin adverts, and as unpaid; facebook shares, linkedin shares, engine searches and direct website access.
Direct access to the website takes the lead by far with all other sources showing similar performances to each other and slightly better than partner adverts. Average number of visited pages per visitor do not show significant change only being lower than average for Facebook adverts. As a summary, more focus on Linked-in as advert campaign and the website itself is recommended
## Overview of User Activity Per Platform
To evaluate user activity per platform drop-out measure is added. The drop-out shows the percentage of visits which started a purchase and yet not completed. For all measures, user activity from all platforms is around same levels; 62% average drop-out and 14% conversion rates. However, slightly higher drop-out rates and slightly lower conversion rates are observed for “ios” and “mac” and a review on website’s compatibility for these platforms may require some improvements. Further platform-based analysis on user activity can be conducted when users with “unknown” platforms hold less proportion in the database.
## Stages to Focus for Improvement
When visited pages right before “contact us” are checked, regardless of the platform, visitors had the need to contact after “pricing” section the most followed by “home”. These pages should be reviewed in user experience perspective and improved as per received questions and feedback.
## Overview of User Activity Per Source
We can evaluate user activity in two divisions as adverts vs shares in
social media and search engine vs direct access to the website. As can be seen in the visualisations in the code,
social media shares significantly outperform
adverts with both a lower drop-out rate and higher
conversion rate. And direct access significantly outperforms search
engine access with both a lower drop-out rate and
higher conversion rate.

Social media shares are more effective than adverts therefore, instead of paid adverts, a “product posts/shares”
focused social media campaign can be proceeded. Between search engine and direct access to the website, direct
access highly outperforms which is natural as a user coming directly to the website is highly likely determined to
purchase however, search engine performance of the website can be looked for improvements.
## Comparing the Success of Two Blogs on the Website
To get an insight about two blogs’ performance, total views, conversion rates and exit
rates are measured. Blog 1 has views twice as blog 2 where blog 2 has very low exit rate indicating visitors tend to
stay more in the website after viewing it. Conversions for blogs are measured by filtering visits having either one of
the blogs as there is not enough proof to decide which blog converted into purchase. Noting this pre-processing, blog
2 converts better therefore, similar blogs are more recommended for the future of the website.
